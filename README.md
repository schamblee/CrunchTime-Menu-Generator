# CrunchTime

Interactive, weekly recipe menu generator. Users can search for a recipe by ingredient, plan not to cook on certain days and search through popular recipes and print weekly menus.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a simple tool for making a weekly menu of recipes. Rather than scrolling through hundreds of recipe options, CrunchTime pulls seven popular recipes based on the user's diet. The user can either print out the inital menu, or alter it with the "next", "previous" and "search" features. The "print" feature allows the user to print out easy-to-read directions for their menu.
